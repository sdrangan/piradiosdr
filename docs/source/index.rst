Pi-Radio SDR for Upper Mid-Band Wireless Experimentation
========================================================

The upper mid-band from 6-24 GHz that has attracted considerable for new 
cellular services due to the balance of spectrum and coverage.
Building systems in these bands require new technologies for spectral agility
for the wide bandwidths, frequency hopping, and coordination with incumbents.
NYU startup 
`Pi-Radio <https://www.pi-rad.io/home>`_  has developed a power new 
software defined radio (SDR) to enable rapid experimentation in the upper mid-band.
This repository will provide software and hardware tools for developing
experiments in the upper mid-band. 

The site is under construction.
